            <h2>Our Vision</h2>
            <p>
              The principle goal of The Watoto Library is to have an impact on the lives of many kids living with the traumas of poverty, faced by domestic violence, denied or not provided with the space to express their thoughts and feelings.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our library is dedicated to provide a safe and welcoming environment to kids so that they can come in and feel loved and appreciated. We are creating a society that values and respects its children. 
            </p>
            <p>
              A place where they can freely embrace who they are. Understand the value of one another. Engage them in activities that will help boost their confidence, self-esteem and improve their focus in all that they do.
            </p>
            <p>
              We believe that every child is special in their own way. Our vision is to see more kids have a place to do their studies with access to study materials in a safe environment.
            </p>

            <h3>Who We Are Engaging With</h3>
            <p>
              Anytime you visit Kibera you will be met with vibrant, loving, brilliant young kids filled with love and care for one another. Kids who are faced with challenges that require them to tackle with resilience, patience and hope. As young as four, the kids know that they must work extra hard for a better future for themselves and their families.
            </p>
            <p>
              These kids go to public schools around them and the majority of these schools are overwhelmed by the number of kids attending. The resources provided by the government are scarce leaving the schools surviving for excitance. When a classroom is filled with over ninety children and only one class teacher, you will find that many of the kids go unnoticed, unappreciated, and not well taken care of.
            </p>
            <p>
              The kids come from very humble backgrounds, from families that can barely maintain or even afford their basic needs. They live to survive each day. Sharing in the struggles of their parents, neighbours and friends hoping for brighter days ahead. They are faced with challenges as early as childhood and are filled with many responsibilities. The children are not given the space to express themselves and the freedom to be children. Most of the time they become co-parents to their siblings or young ones when their parents are out in search of food.
            </p>
            <p>
              Living in single rooms, without running water and having to share a bathroom or washroom with more than hundreds of strangers, these kids live in the traumas of poverty. They witness domestic violence happening at home. They struggle to find guidance and support, hence ending up not knowing where they belong.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Why The Watoto Library</h3>
            <p>
              The Watoto Library is a support system to children suffering silently and wishing to speak out. We help play a vital role in empowering them by diligently promoting their confidence and self esteem. This is being done through various activities and games such as chess, scrabble and other board games.
            </p>
            <p>
              We want to impact their childhood by also encouraging them to have self discipline. We believe that they are the future leaders of our nation and the world. We believe that when they are treated with compassion, kindness, love and care, they will grow up appreciating and respecting one another at the same time building a culture of togetherness filled with empathy for one another.
            </p>
            <p>
              When you visit our library, you will be inspired to see older kids teaching young kids the little knowledge that they have. We have created a culture of openness, trust and respect among the kids to help them believe in themselves and one another. We play our role by providing a place with electricity, sitting and writing area. We are currently looking for funds to help us buy more study materials such as textbooks that will aid the kids with their learning.
