          <h3>Our Vision</h3>
          <p>The principle goal of The Watoto Library is to have an impact on the lives of many kids living with the traumas of poverty, faced by domestic violence, denied or not provided with the space to express their thoughts and feelings.</p>
          <p>&#9733;</p>
          <p>Our library is dedicated to provide a safe and welcoming environment to kids so that they can come in and feel loved and appreciated. We are creating a society that values and respects its children. </p>
          <p>&#9733;</p>
          <p>A place where they can freely embrace who they are. Understand the value of one another. Engage them in activities that will help boost their confidence, self-esteem and improve their focus in all that they do.</p>

                Our Kibera Local Water Forum group is on a crucial mission. 
                We are dedicated to restoring and beautifying a long section of the Nairobi River that flows through our community. 
                In the past, this river played a crucial role in enhancing our community's well-being, 
                serving as a source of clean water for drinking, bathing, and washing clothes. 
                It even used to be a thriving fishing and swimming spot for the community. 
              </p>

              <p>
                However, as our community expanded, the increased population density placed immense pressure on our limited resources. 
                Tragically, the river transformed from a lifeline into a dumping ground, accumulating all sorts of waste, 
                including plastic and even human waste. 
                The water has become so polluted that it can no longer support any form of life, 
                and its appearance has drastically transformed, resembling sewage water more than ever before.

              <h3>Stepping Up For Our Community</h3>
              <p>
                To support our community, we made the decision to take care of a section of the river. 
                Over the past six months and continuing, every Friday and Saturday morning, 
                we have devoted six hours a week to community service. 
                We have been conducting regular cleanup activities with the assistance of our library children, 
                their parents, friends of the library, neighbours, and numerous other community volunteers.

                <h3>Our Goal</h3>
              <p>
                Our primary goal has been to improve the water by addressing the water quality 
                of the river through the removal of accumulated garbage, which had reached a point of forming islands, 
                a realization we had later on. 
                We aim to restore the clean and healthy river that Kibera used to depend on.

                <h3>Accomplishments So Far</h3>
                <p>
                    Our accomplishments so far remain dear to us, especially having witnessed the condition of the river before. 
                    When we began working on the river, the water wasn't flowing, 
                    and the garbage had blocked the river to the extent that one could walk right 
                    across it without realizing it was the river they were crossing. 
                    Fabric materials, plastics, and all sorts of trash had filled the river with years of accumulated garbage. 
                </p>
            </div>
            <img src="../media/whatWeDo/klwf/383079899_6638772229570090_5112142846467368288_n.jpg" class="img">

                    Today, the river is breathing again as we have successfully restored a section to maintain a continuous flow of water. 
                    This has motivated the locals to cease dumping into the river. 
                    They now dispose of their waste at a designated area we've established as a temporary dumping site. 
                    From there, we sort and recycle the materials and then coordinate and put pressure on 
                    government officials to come and collect non-recyclable waste.
