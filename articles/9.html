          <h3>Our Vision</h3>
          <p>The principle goal of The Watoto Library is to have an impact on the lives of many kids living with the traumas of poverty, faced by domestic violence, denied or not provided with the space to express their thoughts and feelings.</p>
          <p>&#9733;</p>
          <p>Our library is dedicated to provide a safe and welcoming environment to kids so that they can come in and feel loved and appreciated. We are creating a society that values and respects its children. </p>
          <p>&#9733;</p>
          <p>A place where they can freely embrace who they are. Understand the value of one another. Engage them in activities that will help boost their confidence, self-esteem and improve their focus in all that they do.</p>

                <p>
                    This month of June has provided an opportunity for our children, along with their parents and our staff, 
                    to join forces. We have embarked on a mission to make a difference for our community. 
                    We have joined hands with the Kibera Local Water Forum, which is also headed by our own director 
                    Brandon Okoth.

                <h3>A River in Need of Rescue</h3>
                <p>
                    It is important for the children, together with their parents, 
                    to be included in this movement of rescuing a dying river that has been turned into a dumping site. 
                    The Nairobi River, once a vibrant river abundant with fish, now faces a sad reality. 
                    The river is heavily polluted, burdened with all kinds of garbage, ranging from plastic waste to human waste. 
                    The river finds itself in a critical situation, demanding immediate attention and action.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Earlier this year, we made plans to do <u><a onclick="location.href='../articles/8.html';" target="_blank">cleanups around Kibera</a></u>
                    to improve the water quality of the community.
                    We are thrilled to see these plans being implemented, and we are proud to share that our children and staff 
                    are actively volunteering and devoting their time to community service activities.

                <h3>Our Participation in The River Cleanup</h3>
                <p>
                    An active participation in the river clean-up has been witnessed by our children and staff members. 
                    The children's involvement is crucial in achieving sustainable change. 
                    Over the past three Saturdays, they have actively taken part in the river clean-up, 
                    assisting in collecting and sorting garbage in and around the river area. 
                </p>
                <p> Their participation is highly valued as we recognize their potential to make a significant impact 
                    on their environment and the Kibera community. 
                    We aim to provide the children with opportunities to observe, learn, and actively participate, 
                    nurturing them to become the future leaders who genuinely understand the necessary actions for a better tomorrow. </p>

                  <p>
                    The struggles of our community are similar to those of the Korogocho community. 
                    Twenty of our children had the privilege to visit and interact with the team from KombGreens 
                    Solutions in Korogocho Slums. 
                    Their remarkable efforts have transformed a once-dumping site into a beautiful park, 
                    where the residents of Korogocho can now relax, hold meetings, 
                    or even read a book under the shade of the trees they have planted. 
                  </p>

          <div class="flex-image-text">
                <div>
                  <p>
                    The children were deeply impressed and expressed their aspirations to have similar 
                    green spaces in Kibera, where they can enjoy and connect with nature. 
                    The children had a wonderful opportunity to explore and learn about vegetable farming, 
                    witnessing firsthand the remarkable transformation that has taken place in Korogocho.

                  <p>
                    Our library children shared their knowledge and played chess with the children at 
                    KombGreens Solutions, bringing immense joy to our hearts. 
                    Witnessing our children introduce, teach, and play chess with the children in Korogocho, 
                    who were encountering the game for the first time, was a heartwarming and remarkable experience.

                    We aspire for our library children to become ambassadors of change, leading by example. 
                    We all have a role to play in supporting and encouraging them to maintain their passion and 
                    dedication towards their community. 
                    Let us engage and support the children by placing our trust in them and providing opportunities 
                    for them to showcase their abilities.
