          <h3>Our Vision</h3>
          <p>The principle goal of The Watoto Library is to have an impact on the lives of many kids living with the traumas of poverty, faced by domestic violence, denied or not provided with the space to express their thoughts and feelings.</p>
          <p>&#9733;</p>
          <p>Our library is dedicated to provide a safe and welcoming environment to kids so that they can come in and feel loved and appreciated. We are creating a society that values and respects its children. </p>
          <p>&#9733;</p>
          <p>A place where they can freely embrace who they are. Understand the value of one another. Engage them in activities that will help boost their confidence, self-esteem and improve their focus in all that they do.</p>

                <h2>How The Watoto Library Started</h2>
                <h5>By: <i>Brandon Francis, Founder</i></h5>
                <p>- As I was walking around my neighborhood in Kibera, I came to a stand stop when I spotted one school moving
                  their books out of their library. They had been renting the space as their own for several years. 
                </p>
              </div>

            <br>
            <p>
              I had always wished that they would allow anyone from the community to use the space, but since it was a
              private school library, it only belonged to the students of that school. You rarely spot a library in Kibera
              and when you do so, most the time it is owned or ran by a private individual or organization, and only
              those associated with them are allowed to access.
            </p>

                <h3>What I saw vs what I imagined</h3>
                <p>The space itself was not that well maintained. The electric wires were hanging on the ceiling and it was
                  clear that it was damaged by the movers as they were un-attaching the bookshelves. The floor was
                  rough and the walls had remains of glued papers that looked like picture charts. The room was dark
                  filled with dust and dirt.</p>
              </div>

            <div class="flex-image-text">

                <h3>Planning and finding solutions</h3>
                <p>All this time as I was taking note of the space, in my imagination I was seeing it in a completely different
                  way. I saw the place renovated, kids from different backgrounds and homes within Kibera using the
                  space filled with joy. I imaged the place colorful and welcoming. Kids coming in to read books, to do
                  their school assignments, and to get free academic assistance and materials.

                <h3>Turning a vision into an action</h3>
                <p>I had visioned the place to accommodate young minds that needed to be actively involved in things
                  that would later help them become better version of themselves. I have lived in Kibera my entire
                  childhood. I believe I know and understand some of the challenges the kids face.</p>

            <div class="flex-image-text">
              <div>
                <p>I decided to look for the owner of the place to negotiate for it. After we came to an understanding, I
                  started the process of transforming the empty space into becoming what it is today. I borrowed some
                  of my grandma's old furniture, painted and brought them into the space. Without noticing kids started
                  coming in one by one. I had seen an opportunity for them, one that I was not going to let go, and out of
                  commitment and determination, The Watoto Library is serving its purpose in our community.</p>
