                <h2>Starting The Watoto Library</h2>
                <p>As I, Brandon, was walking around my neighborhood in Kibera, I came to a stand stop when I spotted one school moving
                  their books out of their library. They had been renting the space as their own for several years. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  I had always wished that they would allow anyone from the community to use the space, but since it was a
                  private school library, it only belonged to the students of that school. 
                </p>
              </div>
              <img src="../media/study/group-studying-reduced.jpeg" class="img">
            </div>
              <p>You rarely spot a library in Kibera
                and when you do so, most the time it is owned or ran by a private individual or organization, and only
                those associated with them are allowed to access.</p>
              <br>
              <h3>What I saw vs what I imagined</h3>
              <p>The space itself was not that well maintained. The electric wires were hanging on the ceiling and it was
                clear that it was damaged by the movers as they were un-attaching the bookshelves. The floor was
                rough and the walls had remains of glued papers that looked like picture charts. The room was dark
                filled with dust and dirt.</p>
              <p>All this time as I was taking note of the space, in my imagination I was seeing it in a completely different
                way. I saw the place renovated, kids from different backgrounds and homes within Kibera using the
                space filled with joy. I imaged the place colorful and welcoming. Kids coming in to read books, to do
                their school assignments, and to get free academic assistance and materials.</p>
                <br>
              <h3>Turning a vision into an action</h3>
              <p>I had visioned the place to accommodate young minds that needed to be actively involved in things
                that would later help them become better version of themselves. I have lived in Kibera my entire
                childhood. I believe I know and understand some of the challenges the kids face.</p>
              <p>I decided to look for the owner of the place to negotiate for it. After we came to an understanding, I
                started the process of transforming the empty space into becoming what it is today. I borrowed some
                of my grandma's old furniture, painted and brought them into the space. Without noticing kids started
                coming in one by one. I had seen an opportunity for them, one that I was not going to let go, and out of
                commitment and determination, The Watoto Library is serving its purpose in our community.</p>
