          <p>The principle goal of The Watoto Library is to have an impact on the lives of many kids living with the traumas of poverty, faced by domestic violence, denied or not provided with the space to express their thoughts and feelings.</p>
          <p>&#9733;</p>
          <p>Our library is dedicated to provide a safe and welcoming environment to kids so that they can come in and feel loved and appreciated. We are creating a society that values and respects its children. </p>
          <p>&#9733;</p>
          <p>A place where they can freely embrace who they are. Understand the value of one another. Engage them in activities that will help boost their confidence, self-esteem and improve their focus in all that they do.</p>

                  The Kibera community is a place of resilience, filled with wonderful and kind-hearted people who hold onto hope for a better and brighter future. 
                  Every day, our library welcomes more children through its doors, and we have witnessed an increase in the number of those accessing and using our space. 
                  We pray and hope that we may continue to grow to serve a larger population of the community.

                Our goal remains the same: To transform and positively change the lives of many children by giving them access to books that would broaden their knowledge and inspire them to achieve their dreams. 
                We understand the struggles the children go through on a daily basis, and we take immense pride and joy in facilitating a safe and welcoming space where children can engage in reading and learning, knowing that they are loved and cared for.

                <p>
                  There is a child who wakes up every morning to face a tough reality. 
                  Some go to school without having any meal because they cannot afford it, and they are forced to wait until lunch hour when the school provides lunch. 
                  Even with the hardships they experience, the children continue to work hard in their academics. 
                  As a library space, we have taken it upon ourselves to advocate and be a support system that provides each and every one of them with a space to showcase their greatness.

                  We understand that living in a busy and crowded community like Kibera can often be overwhelming and exhausting for young minds trying to make sense of everything around them. 
                  We are privileged to have caring and supportive children within our community, children who understand the value of living as brothers and sisters, supporting and looking out for one another.

                  <h3>Schooling In Kibera</h3>
                  <p>
                    Many of our regular kids attend public schools in Kibera.
                    The classrooms are overcrowded, exceeding their capacity. 
                    One of the biggest schools in Kibera, where many of our kids go to school,
                    has a population of more than 5,000 students and over 100 pupils per class. 
                    Shared facilities, like toilets, often have to accommodate a ratio of well over 1:100 children. 
                  </p>

                  <h3>No Learning Materials</h3>
                  <p>
                    Additionally, many students lack essential learning materials, such as textbooks and writing tools, right from the start of their educational journey. 
                    As a result, a large number of children struggle to study or keep up with their classmates, and often achieve lower academic grades, which sometimes leads some to drop out of school.

                  <h3>We Are The Change We Want</h3>
                  <p>
                    In response to these challenges, our library has taken it upon itself to bring about positive 
                    change. We have been requesting and collecting school textbooks from our friends, 
                    which we have made available for both primary and secondary pupils to use. 
                    Now, children can come in and complete their assignments and schoolwork without 
                    worrying about where to find the necessary textbooks for reference. 
                  </p>

                    We continue to provide them with basic stationery items needed to support their learning, 
                    such as pencils and other writing materials. We are reminded by the great icon 
                    Malala Yousafzai that "One child, one teacher, one book, one pen can change the world." 
                    We firmly believe that any small act of kindness can make a big difference. 
                    Together, we can bring change to these children.

                  <h3>It Is Possible, It Can Happen</h3>
                  <p>
                    It is important for us to empathize with these children and acknowledge the difficulties they face. 
                    Together, we can work to bring about positive change, advocate for better opportunities, 
                    and strive for a world where every child, regardless of their background, can thrive and 
                    fulfill their potential. We, at The Watoto Library, firmly believe that this is possible. 
                    Join us today and support our efforts to continue impacting the lives of many vulnerable children.
