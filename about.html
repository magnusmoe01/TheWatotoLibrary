          <h3>Our Vision</h3>
          <p>The principle goal of The Watoto Library is to have an impact on the lives of many kids living with the traumas of poverty, faced by domestic violence, denied or not provided with the space to express their thoughts and feelings.</p>
          <p>&#9733;</p>
          <p>Our library is dedicated to provide a safe and welcoming environment to kids so that they can come in and feel loved and appreciated. We are creating a society that values and respects its children. </p>
          <p>&#9733;</p>
          <p>A place where they can freely embrace who they are. Understand the value of one another. Engage them in activities that will help boost their confidence, self-esteem and improve their focus in all that they do.</p>

              <h2>About Us</h2>
              <p>
                The Watoto Library is a project that was started in 2021 under SoulKids Norway. The project works to better the lives of children in Kibera by providing free access to a library where kids can come in and read books, to do their school assignments, or get free academic assistance and materials. Our work is soley run by private funds and sponsors, and all our work is done voluntarily.

              <h3>Where We Operate</h3>
              <p>
                The Watoto Library is located in Kibera, in Nairobi, Kenya. Kibera is the largest urban slum in Africa. Around 250,000 people live here in what is defined as extreme poverty, earning less than US$2 per day. Unemployment rates are high and many people cannot afford education for their children.

              <h3>Who We Are Engaging With</h3>
              <p>
                Any time you visit Kibera, you will be met with vibrant, loving, brilliant young kids, filled with love and care for one another. Kids, who should be allowed to just remain kids, but who are faced with challenges that require them to tackle with resilience, patience and hope. As young as four, the kids know that they must work extra hard for a better future for themselves and their families.

              <h3>The School Situation in Kibera</h3>
              <p>
                Some kids go to public schools around them, and the majority of these schools are overwhelmed by the number of kids attending. The resources provided by the government are scarce, leaving the schools surviving for excistance. When a classroom is filled with over ninety children and only one class teacher, you will find that many of the kids go unnoticed, unappreciated, and not well taken care of.

          <h3>The Life of A Kibera Child</h3>
          <p>
            The kids come from very humble backgrounds, from families that can barely maintain or even afford their basic needs. They live to survive each day. Sharing in the struggles of their parents, neighbours and friends, hoping for brighter days ahead. 
          </p>
          <p>
            They are faced with challenges as early as childhood and are filled with many responsibilities. The children are not given the space to express themselves and the freedom to be children. Most of the time they become co-parents to their siblings or young ones when their parents are out in search of food.
          </p>
          <p>
            Living in single rooms, without running water and having to share a bathroom or washroom with more than hundreds of strangers, these kids live in the traumas of poverty. They witness domestic violence happening at home. They struggle to find guidance and support, hence ending up not knowing where they belong.

              <h3>Why The Watoto Library</h3>
              <p>
                The Watoto Library is a support system to children suffering silently and wishing to speak out. We help play a vital role in empowering them by diligently promoting their confidence and self esteem. This is being done through various activities and games such as chess, scrabble and other board games.
              </p>
            </div>
            <img src="media/about/working-together.jpeg" class="img">
          </div>
          <p>
            We want to impact their childhood by also encouraging them to have self discipline. We believe that when they are treated with compassion, kindness, love and care, they will grow up appreciating and respecting one another at the same time building a culture of togetherness filled with empathy for one another.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you visit our library, you will be inspired to see older kids teaching young kids the little knowledge that they have. We have created a culture of openness, trust and respect among the kids to help them believe in themselves and one another. We play our role by providing a place with electricity, sitting and writing area. We are currently looking for funds to help us buy more study materials such as textbooks that will aid the kids with their learning.

              <h3>The Founder</h3>
              <p>
                The founder, Brandon Francis Okoth, was himself born in Kibera. He joined SoulKids as a volunteer in 2008. He was then only 8 years old but already stood out as a responsible boy, taking care of all the small kids in the area, and thus becoming an important reporter from the slums to SoulKids.
              </p>
            </div>
            <img src="media/about/BrandonAndKids.jpeg" class="img">
          </div>
          <p>
            At the age of 14, he started Brandon's Academy where he sponsored children in school from 1-8th grade and high school. He took the role of coordinator and advisor as well, and is the person who is in contact with the school, parents and sponsors. He has always taken a big part in the children's education and wanted to help imporove their situation.
          </p>
          <p>
            From a young age he always thought about starting a library where kids can come in an study, engage and grow. In 2021 he decided to put thought to action and found a suitable place, set it up, and later partnered with SoulKids Norway. Now we are working together for a better future.
