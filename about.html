            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>
              The Watoto Library is a project that was started in 2021 under SoulKids Norway. The project works to __. Our work is soley run by private funds and sponsors, and all our work is done voluntary.

            <h3>Why The Watoto Library</h3>
            <p>
              The Watoto Library is a support system to children suffering silently and wishing to speak out. We help play a vital role in empowering them by diligently promoting their confidence and self esteem. This is being done through various activities and games such as chess, scrabble and other board games.
            </p>
            <p>
              We want to impact their childhood by also encouraging them to have self discipline. We believe that they are the future leaders of our nation and the world. We believe that when they are treated with compassion, kindness, love and care, they will grow up appreciating and respecting one another at the same time building a culture of togetherness filled with empathy for one another.
            </p>
            <p>
              When you visit our library, you will be inspired to see older kids teaching young kids the little knowledge that they have. We have created a culture of openness, trust and respect among the kids to help them believe in themselves and one another. We play our role by providing a place with electricity, sitting and writing area. We are currently looking for funds to help us buy more study materials such as textbooks that will aid the kids with their learning.

              <h3>The Founder</h3>
              <p>
                The founder, Brandon Francis Okoth, was himself born in Kibera. He joined SoulKids as a volunteer in 2008. He was then only 8 years old but already stood out as a responsible boy, taking care of all the small kids in the area, and thus becoming an important reporter from the slums to SoulKids.
              </p>
              <p>
                At the age of 14, he started Brandon's Academy, and he is now sponsoring children in school from 1-8th grade and high school. He has taken the role of coordinator as well and is the person who is in touch with the school, the parents and sponsors. He takes a big part in the children's education and is working as an advisor to parents and other caregivers.
